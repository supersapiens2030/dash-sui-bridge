# Dash ↔ Sui Bridge (wDASH)

**Goal**: Bring Dash’s ~175 k daily real-world transactions (InstantSend payments) to Sui as native wDASH for DeFi, gaming and payments.

**Why this matters**
- Dash: 175 k tx/day, $1.1 B market cap
- Zcash: ~44 k tx/day, $11.7 B market cap
→ Same opportunity that Zolana captured, but 4× bigger and currently untapped.

**Status**: Grant proposal submitted to Sui Foundation / Mysten Labs (Nov 2025)  
**Target TVL**: $10 M+ in first 6 months  
**License**: MIT (fully open-source from day one)

## Planned Milestones
1. Testnet PoC (Wormhole + Sui Bridge API)
2. Move-based contracts + masternode validation
3. Full audit + mainnet launch
4. Liquidity incentives on Cetus / Turbos
